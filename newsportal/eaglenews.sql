The DDO also includes conversion of T-bills held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) into treasury bonds (T-bonds), which has not yet been completed.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Fitch’s view, the exchange of T-bonds constitutes a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under the agency’s criteria, given that the maturity extension of the tendered bonds represents a material reduction in terms versus the original contractual terms, and given that the exchange is needed to avoid a traditional payment default.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Reduction in Terms: Eligible bonds for which tenders were received and accepted have been exchanged into 12 new instruments of equal size and the same aggregate principal amount, maturing between 2027 and 2038. Accepted tenders reached about 37% of the outstanding principal amount of eligible bonds outstanding as of 28 June 2023. Accepted tenders were predominantly by superannuation funds, which will face higher tax rates on income from T-bonds if they did not meet a participation threshold.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Local-Currency Debt Service Continuing: Fitch believes that Sri Lanka has continued to service the T-bonds throughout the DDO process, and that T-bonds not tendered in the exchange will continue to be serviced as per their original terms, including but not limited to the entirety of the 12 series of T-bonds (out of 61 eligible series) for which no valid tenders were received.

Fitch deems the process incomplete, as the exchange of T-bills held by CBSL is still pending. Fitch regards the T-bills as public debt securities, and they are also held by private investors.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Foreign-Currency IDR in Default: The sovereign remains in default on foreign-currency obligations and has initiated a debt restructuring with official and private external creditors.

The iPhone’s phone app will also reposition the hang up button to the bottom right of the screen, next to other functions.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">What not to expect</strong></p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.6; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">With the new iPhone expected to take center stage, many analysts don’t anticipate Apple will release new iPads or Mac computers until October.
